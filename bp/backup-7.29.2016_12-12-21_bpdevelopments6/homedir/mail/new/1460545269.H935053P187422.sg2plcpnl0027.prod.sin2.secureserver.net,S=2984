- http://bpdevelopments6.com


The changes for this version are:

New features in 4.5 help streamline your workflow, whether you're writing or building your site.

Editing Improvements
* Inline Linking: Stay focused on your writing with a less distracting interface that keeps you in place and allows you to easily link to your content.
* Formatting Shortcuts: Do you enjoy using formatting shortcuts for lists and headings? Now they're even more useful, with horizontal lines and &lt;code&gt;.
* Live Responsive Previews: Make sure your site looks great on all screens! Preview mobile, tablet, and desktop views directly in the customizer.
* Custom Logos: Themes can now support logos for your business or brand. Try it out with Twenty Sixteen and Twenty Fifteen in the Site Identity section of the customizer.

Under the Hood
* Smart Image Resizing: Generated images now load up to 50% faster with no noticeable quality loss. It's really cool.
* Selective Refresh: The customizer now supports a comprehensive framework for rendering parts of the preview without rewriting your PHP code in JavaScript.
* Script Loader Improvements: Better support has been added for script header/footer dependencies. New wp_add_inline_script() enables adding extra code to registered scripts.
* Better Embed Templates: Embed templates have been split into parts and can be directly overridden by themes via the template hierarchy.
* JavaScript Library Updates: jQuery 1.12.3, jQuery Migrate 1.4.0, Backbone 1.2.3, and Underscore 1.8.3 are bundled.
